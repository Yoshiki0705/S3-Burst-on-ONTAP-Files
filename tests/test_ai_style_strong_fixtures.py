"""D1 must agree with markdown-it on whether a `**` renders.

Adapted from the Hub (`FSx-for-ONTAP-Adoption-Playbook`,
`scripts/tests/test_ai_style_strong_fixtures.py`). The expected values in
`fixtures/ai_style_strong.json` were produced by markdown-it itself, through the Hub's
`scripts/regenerate_ai_style_fixtures.mjs`. That generator is **not** copied into the spoke (it
needs Node); the JSON is read-only data copied verbatim from the Hub branch. This test reads it
only, so the gate stays stdlib-only and the rule file stays copyable.

The case that motivated the rule reads correctly in the source and does not render:
`は**「X」**で` leaves four literal asterisks, because a `**` between a Japanese particle and a
bracket is neither left- nor right-flanking. Nobody notices it in an editor, which is why it is
checked against a renderer rather than against intuition.
