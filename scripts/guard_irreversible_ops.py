"""Block an agent from unilaterally enabling immutability (WORM) features.

PROVENANCE
----------
Copied verbatim from `scripts/guard_irreversible_ops.py` in
https://github.com/Yoshiki0705/FSx-for-ONTAP-Adoption-Playbook on 2026-09-06, on that repository's
advice: it is stdlib-only and project-independent, and copying the single file is the whole of the
supported use. **No divergence.** Behaviour changes belong upstream, where the incident that produced
this guard is recorded and where its tests live -- a local edit here would be a second version of a
control whose entire value is that it is the same everywhere.

Wired here through `.kiro/hooks/guard-irreversible-ops.json`, pointing at this tracked path rather
than at a copy under `$HOME` or `.kiro/`. Upstream had a wired copy that covered none of S3 Object
Lock, Glacier Vault Lock, Backup Vault Lock or EBS snapshot lock while its AGENTS.md listed all four;
ten documented block cases passed silently, because a copy nobody can see is a copy nobody updates.

Why it is here at all: the SMB gaps (a client-count ladder, a 15-minute sustained write, and reads
with the cache-hit ratio controlled) need the measurement environment rebuilt, and building an
environment is when this class of mistake happens. Upstream's incident happened during exactly that
work.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-08-06 an AI agent working in this repository created an Amazon FSx for NetApp
ONTAP SnapLock audit log volume in order to verify a documented claim. It did not ask
which retention period to use, and it read the relevant warning only *after* the
operation failed to reverse.

One 128 MiB volume made the volume, its storage virtual machine, and **the entire file
system** undeletable for six months. The agent had also already set privileged delete to
`PERMANENTLY_DISABLED`, which closed the only remaining escape route. The verification it
was performing produced no usable finding.

The general lesson is not about SnapLock. It is this:

    A feature whose stated purpose is to remove your ability to delete data must never
    be enabled by an agent acting on its own judgement.

Such a feature working correctly is indistinguishable from an outage you caused. There is
no rollback, no support escalation that reliably helps, and the blast radius is routinely
wider than the resource you named in the call.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Reads a Kiro PreToolUse hook payload on stdin, extracts the command, and exits 2 (block)
when the command both (a) touches an immutability or terminal-state feature and (b) is
mutating. Read-only inspection is always allowed, because refusing to let an agent *look*
would just push it toward guessing.

Exit codes: 0 allow, 2 block (stderr is shown to the agent).

SELF-TEST
---------
Run `python3 guard_irreversible_ops.py --selftest`. It covers all three verdicts — block
(exit 2), ask (exit 0 plus a permissionDecision payload on stdout), and allow (exit 0,
silent) — because a guard that only proves it blocks has not shown that it lets ordinary
work through, and over-blocking is what gets guards switched off.

The cases live in this file rather than
in a separate harness for a concrete reason: once the guard is wired to a hook, **passing a
sample locking command on the command line gets the test run itself blocked.** That happened
during development. Keeping the cases inside the module means verifying the guard never
requires a matching string to cross the shell — and the alternative, rewriting the sample to
slip past the pattern, is exactly the bypass this guard exists to prevent.

REUSE
-----
Stdlib only, no repository-specific assumptions. Copy it into any project and wire it to
a PreToolUse hook. Extend IMMUTABILITY_PATTERNS as you meet new features; the categories
matter more than the exact list.

BLOCKED: this command enables or alters an immutability / terminal-state feature.

  Feature area : {areas}
  Matched      : {matches}

An agent must not decide this on its own. These features work by removing the ability to
delete, so a mistake cannot be undone by you, by the account owner, or reliably by AWS
Support. The affected scope is regularly wider than the resource named in the call — an
FSx for ONTAP SnapLock audit log volume, for example, locks its SVM and the whole file
system for a minimum of six months, in Enterprise mode too.

Do this instead:

  1. Stop. Do not retry, and do not look for an equivalent call that evades this check.
  2. Tell the human, in the conversation, exactly:
       - which resource the operation targets,
       - what becomes undeletable, and for how long,
       - the widest scope affected (volume? SVM? file system? account?),
       - the cost of holding that scope for the full period,
       - whether any documented path exists to reverse it early (usually: none).
  3. Ask for the retention value explicitly. Never infer it, never accept a service
     default silently, and state the minimum the service permits.
  4. Proceed only on an instruction that names the value and the scope.

If this is verification work, ask whether a disposable, dedicated file system or account
should be used first. Verification is never a reason to skip this gate — the incident that
produced this guard was verification work, and it yielded no usable finding.
